I understand now. You want to extract the title from the content of the `<h2>` tag and use it as the actual content of the tag. This is a bit tricky because we're essentially parsing HTML within HTML. However, we can achieve this using Django's template tags and filters. Here's how you can do it:

    1. First, let's create a custom template filter to extract the title. Create a new file named `utils.py` in your app's `templatetags` directory:
    
    ```python
    # templatetags/utils.py
    from django import template
    import re
    
    register = template.Library()
    
    @register.filter(name='extract_title')
    def extract_title(value):
        match = re.search(r'title:(.*)}', value)
        if match:
            return match.group(1).strip()
        return ''
    ```
    
    2. Now, in your template, you can use this filter to extract the title and then use it within the `<h2>` tag. Here's how you can modify your template:
    
    ```html
    {% load utils %}
    
    <h2 class="profile-title">{{ title|extract_title }}</h2>
    ```
    
    This approach does the following:
    
    - The `extract_title` filter uses a regular expression to find the content between `title:` and the closing curly brace `}`.
    - It strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the extracted title.
    - If no match is found, it returns an empty string.
    
    However, this method assumes that the `title` variable always contains the same format of content. If the format varies, you might need to adjust the regular expression accordingly.
    
    Alternatively, if you have more control over how the `title` variable is populated in your view, you could simplify this process:
    
    1. In your view, split the title content:
    
    ```python
    def your_view(request):
        # Assuming your title comes from somewhere...
        raw_title = "title:Some Actual Title}"
        title_parts = raw_title.split(':')
        if len(title_parts) > 1:
            actual_title = title_parts[1].strip('}')
        else:
            actual_title = ''
        
        return render(request, 'your_template.html', {'actual_title': actual_title})
    ```
    
    2. Then in your template, simply use:
    
    ```html
    <h2 class="profile-title">{{ actual_title }}</h2>
    ```
    
    This approach is cleaner and more reliable, especially if you have control over how the title is structured in your backend.
    
    Which of these approaches aligns better with your current setup and requirements? Or do you need any modifications to either of these solutions?
